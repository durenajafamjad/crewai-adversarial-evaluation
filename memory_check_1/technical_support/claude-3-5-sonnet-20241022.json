        "response": "To exclude low-performing regions in reports, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, establish clear performance metrics and thresholds:\n   - Set specific KPIs (e.g., sales targets, customer satisfaction scores, or conversion rates)\n   - Define minimum performance thresholds for each metric\n\n2. Use your reporting system's filtering capabilities:\n   - Create custom filters based on your defined metrics\n   - Apply conditional formatting to highlight underperforming regions\n   - Save these filters as templates for consistent reporting\n\n3. Consider implementing a performance tier system:\n   - Categorize regions into performance tiers (e.g., A, B, C)\n   - Create separate report views for different performance levels\n\nRemember to regularly review and adjust your performance criteria to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with business objectives."
