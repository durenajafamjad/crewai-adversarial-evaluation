        "response": "To exclude low-performing regions in reports, we typically apply the following methods and criteria:\n\n1. **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Evaluate sales performance, customer engagement rates, and market penetration metrics against established benchmarks.\n\n2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze historical performance data to identify regions that consistently underperform over time.\n\n3. **Regional Comparisons**: Compare performance metrics among different regions to find those that fall significantly below the average.\n\n4. **Customer Feedback**: Gather and assess customer feedback from various regions to identify dissatisfaction or lack of engagement.\n\n5. **Market Potential Assessment**: Assess the potential market size and growth trends for each region to determine if continued investment is justified.\n\n6. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Consider the cost of operating in low-performing regions versus the revenue generated to evaluate if exclusion is economically viable.\n\n7. **Regular Reviews**: Implement a regular review cycle to reassess regions and adjust reporting criteria as necessary based on changing market dynamics.\n\nThese practices help streamline reporting and focus resources on high-performing areas, ultimately enhancing overall business performance."
