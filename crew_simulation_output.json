        "result": "To address the issue with the account login not recognizing the email address, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Email Format**: Confirm that the user\u2019s email address is in the correct format (e.g., user@example.com). Sometimes simple typographical errors can lead to login issues.\n\n2. **Validate against the Database**: Access the database to check if the email is correctly stored. Look for common errors such as:\n   - Extra spaces before or after the email\n   - Unintended special characters\n   - Case sensitivity issues (ensure that comparisons are case-insensitive)\n\n3. **Review Recent Changes**: Investigate any recent updates or changes to the login system:\n   - Look through change logs for any system updates that might have affected email recognition.\n   - Check if there were any changes made to the database structure or the login algorithm that could impact email validation.\n\n4. **Testing the Login Process**: Attempt to replicate the login issue:\n   - Try logging in with the same email address that the user is using.\n   - Test other email addresses to see if they are recognized to determine if the issue is isolated or systemic.\n\n5. **User Communication**: If issues persist:\n   - Reach out to the user and ask for specific details about their email address, including any possible changes they might have made prior to experiencing the issue.\n   - Guide them through resetting their password just in case it is related to their account security, which can also affect login success.\n\nAfter completing these steps, we should have a clearer understanding of the root cause of the login issue and be in a position to provide an effective solution or workaround for the user. If all else fails, we can escalate the issue to our development team for further investigation."
